# Variables Practice

# Demonstrate in this script that you know how to:
# add a comment block to the top of your Python script
# define (create) Python variables and
# assign string and numeric values to your variables
# use the Python print function to print the value you assigned to a variable on your computer screen

# Remember:
# A string is just a piece of text (Examples: Mikey, Traverse City, hot dog)
# An integer is a number -- a numeric value -- that doesn't have a decimal point (Example: 42)
# A float (AKA floating-point number) is a number -- a numeric value -- that DOES have a decimal point (Example: 3.2537)

# Part 1 / Working with Text (String  Data)
# Define a variable called school and assign it the string value Career Tech (using a pair of single quotes)
school = 'career tech'
# Define a variable called favorite_singer and assign it the string value that is your favorite singer (using a pair of double quotes)
singer = "david bryne"
# Define a variable called greeting and assign it a string value you'd use to greet someone (Good morning, Good afternoon, etc.)
greeting = 'howdy do!'
# Use the print function to print the value of one of three variables you created in Part 1
print (greeting)




# Part 2 / Working with Numbers (Numeric Data)
# Define a variable called my_age and assign it your age as an integer
my_age = '16 is my age'
# Define a variable called conversion_factor and assign it the value of 2.54 (a float/floating-point number)
conversion_factor = 2.54
# Define a variable called book_price and assign it a value of 20.99 (a float/floating-point number)
book_price = 20.99
# Use the print function to print the value of one of three variables you created in Part 2
print (my_age)




# Part 3 / Working with the print ( ) Function
# Create three different variables, one for each piece of data described below
# Remember to follow the rules for naming Python variables
# Use the print function to print your first name on your screen
first_name = 'apollos'

print (first_name)
# Use the print function to print the name of the city you live in on your screen
home_city = 'williamsburg'

print (home_city)
# Use the print function to print your age on your computer screen

age = 16

print (age)
